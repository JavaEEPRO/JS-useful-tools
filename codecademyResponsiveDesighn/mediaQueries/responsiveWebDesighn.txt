Responsive Web Design
When someone visits a website, it's possible they are viewing it on a phone, tablet, computer, or even a TV monitor. Because screen sizes can vary greatly across different devices, it's important for websites to resize and reorganize their content to best fit screens of all sizes.

When a website doesn't respond to different screen sizes, the website may look odd or become indecipherable on certain devices. This usually occurs on smaller screens, like phones. When a website responds to the size of the screen it's viewed on, itâ€™s called a responsive website.
