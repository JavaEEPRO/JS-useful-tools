//Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.(Luke 18:17)

import React from 'react';
import { styles } from './styles';

const h1Style = {
  color:      styles.color,
  fontSize:   styles.fontSize,
  fontFamily: styles.fontFamily,
  padding:    styles.padding,
  margin:     0
};

export class AttentionGrabber extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return <h1 style={h1Style}>WELCOME TO MY HOMEPAGE!</h1>;
	}
}

Share Styles Across Multiple Components
What if you want to reuse styles for several different components?

One way to make styles reusable is to keep them in a separate JavaScript file. This file should export the styles that you want to reuse, via export. You can then import your styles into any component that wants them.

In the code editor, move back and forth between facebookStyles.js and FacebookColorThief.js to see a styles file in action.
