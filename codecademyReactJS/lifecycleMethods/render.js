MOUNTING LIFECYCLE METHODS
render
render is a lifecycle method!

We won't go over render here - we've already talked about it plenty. However, you should understand how render fits into the mounting period. Whenever a component mounts, componentWillMount is called first, followed by render, followed by componentDidMount.

render belongs to two categories: mounting lifecycle methods, and updating lifecycle methods. We'll cover updating lifecycle methods in the next lesson. But first, there's one final mounting lifecycle method!
