REACT FORMS
React Forms Recap
Great work! You just wrote your first React form.

Notice that you didn't use a submit button. You didn't even use a <form> element! Your "form" was actually just an <input />.

That won't always be the case. You will still sometimes want a <form> element and a submit button, especially if you need to differentiate between a finished form and an in-progress form. But in some cases, it's fine to have a "form" that is really just an input field.

This is because, unlike in the traditional form paradigm, in React you re-send your form on every single character change. That removes the need to ever "submit" anything.

That marks the end of this unit! You've learned a wide variety of important techniques: inline styles, separating container and presentational components, stateless functional components, proptypes, and forms. You'll review all of it in the next course! There is only one major tool still missing from your toolbelt: lifestyle methods. We'll cover those in this course's final unit.
